Home contain one level02.pcap file.
A common software to read pcap files is WireShark, which we need to download on our
local machine. We also need to transfer to pcap file to the local machine using scp as usual.

		scp -P 4242 scp://level02@127.0.0.1/level02.pcap level02/Ressources


Using Wireshark we can now see the stream of packets in in the same order the 
network received them by following TCP stream.

And we can now see all char in ASCII enter by the user after the password prompt. '.' are not printable in ASCII.
Using the Hexdump feature we can see which ASCII characters these are.
The 4 first ones are 7F and the last one is 0d

Décimal   Octal   Hex  Binaire   Caractère
-------   -----   ---  --------    ------
  013      015    0D   00001101      CR    (Carriage Return)
  127      177    7F   01111111      DEL    (delete)


So we can ignore the last char (Carriage Return), remove the 4 deleted char and we have the completed password ft_waNDReL0L.

FLAG02 PASSWORD: ft_waNDReL0L
