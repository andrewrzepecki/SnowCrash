An SUID executable and token file are located in home directory.
		./level09
	You need to provied only one arg.

		./level09 token
	tpmhr

		cat token

	f4kmm6p|=��p�n��DB�Du{���

		xxd token

	0000000: 6634 6b6d 6d36 707c 3d82 7f70 826e 8382  f4kmm6p|=..p.n..

Regarding the output it seems that index position is added to each character which gives following output.

		/level09 "0123456789"

	02468:<>@B

		./level09 "abcdefghij"

	acegikmoqs

Use ltrace to intercept dynamic library calls and system calls executed by the program.

		ltrace ./level09 "abcdefghij"

	__libc_start_main(0x80487ce, 2, 0xbffff7d4, 0x8048aa0, 0x8048b10 <unfinished ...>
	ptrace(0, 0, 1, 0, 0xb7e2fe38) = -1
	puts("You should not reverse this"You should not reverse this) = 28
	+++ exited (status 1) +++

Write a script in /tmp which will subtract index position from each character.

See python script in level09/Ressources/hack.py
