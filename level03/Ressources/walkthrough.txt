Home contains a executable anmed level03.
When run, it prints out "Exploit me".

Using ltrace to see all library calls.

		ltrace ./level03

Notice how the system call uses /usr/bin/env before 'echo'. This means that the system call searchs the fist executable in PATH environement variable.
This means we can provide our own echo, modify the path so that this echo is called in preference to the built-in, and then we can run arbitrary commands.
The easiest way to provide our own echo that runs getflag is to just create a symbolic link to getflag.
As we don't have write rights in homedir, we'll use /tmp.

		ln -s /bin/getflag /tmp/echo
		export PATH=/tmp:$PATH
		./level03
