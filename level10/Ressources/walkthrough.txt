Man page of access warns about security hole.

Warning: Using access() to check if a user is authorized to, for example, open  a file before actually doing so using open(2) creates a security hole
because the user might exploit the short time interval between checking and opening the file to manipulate it.

An answer talk about TOCTOU race (Time of Check to Time of Update).
That is a TOCTOU race (Time of Check to Time of Update). A malicious user could substitute a file he has access to for a symlink to something he doesn't have access to between the access() and the open() calls.

Check hack.sh for the script that forces the symbolic link in a while loop.

Open new window.
